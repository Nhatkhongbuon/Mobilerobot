# Mobile robot follow given trajectory
<ul>
<li>A project me and my friends do when we are 4th years students at HUST. This project about mobile robot can follow the given trajectory using backstepping method.
We detect car's position by reading 2 encoders in motor.</li>
<li>I complete hardware and software for ESP32 and STM32, my friends simulation this project on Matlab and convert algorithms to code C. 
I put some importance link about simulation trajectory, video test... below and I already put the image for this car and paper my team use to do this project in folder documents.</li>
