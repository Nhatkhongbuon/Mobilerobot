# Mobile robot follow given trajectory
A project I and my friends do when we are 4th years students at HUST. This project about mobile robot can follow the given trajectory using backstepping method.
I complete hardware and software for ESP32 and STM32, my friends simulation this project on Matlab and convert algorithms to code C. 
I put some importance link about simulation trajectory, video test... below and I already put the image for this car and paper my team use to do this project in folder documents.
